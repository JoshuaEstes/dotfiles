====================

This is my dotfile. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. My
dotfile is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master
my life. Without me, my dotfile is useless. Without my dotfile, I am useless.

# Installation

    cd $HOME
    git clone git://github.com/JoshuaEstes/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh

This will create a ~/.dotfiles directory with the correct files in it.

# Updating

    cd ~/dotfiles
    git pull origin master
    ./install.sh

Updating should be pretty easy and straight forward.
