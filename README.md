JoshuaEstes/dotfiles
====================

These are my dotfiles, enjoy

Installation
------------



Usage
-----

I use a few different computers all with a different OS. With that, there
are some dotfiles for OSX and Linux. Also I set this up so I can enable/disable
various parts of my dot files.

Enable/Disable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The idea came from apache2 with sites-available/sites-disabled =) Also
there is autocomplete on this stuff so you can see what is there and
what is not there.

alen  = enable an alias
aldis = disable an alias


Git Aliases
-----------

To use just type `git` then one of these commands.

a  = add
c  = commit -m
ca = commit -am
co = checkout
cb = checkout -b
d  = diff
lg = "log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative"
pl = pull
ps = push
r  = remote -v
ss = stash
sl = stash list
sa = stash apply
sd = stash drop
s  = status
t  = tag -n
